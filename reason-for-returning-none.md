In Python, when a function does not explicitly use a `return` statement, it implicitly returns the value `None`. This behavior is part of how Python handles functions that do not return a specific value. Here's why:

### **Reason for Returning `None`:**

1. **Implicit `None` Return**:
   - In Python, if a function does not include a `return` statement, it is assumed that the function does not need to return anything. 
   - The default return value for such functions is `None`, which is **a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value**.
intended
2. **Consistency Across Functions**:
   - This behavior ensures that functions always return a value, even if they don't explicitly return anything. Without this, a function that doesn't return anything would not provide any output, which could lead to confusion or inconsistency in code.
   - By returning `None`, **Python provides a predictable outcome for functions without return statements, making it clear that no specific value was meant to be returned**.

### **Example:**

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

result = greet("Alice")
print(result)  # Output: None
```

- In the example above, the `greet` function doesn't have a `return` statement, so it implicitly returns `None`. When we print the value of `result`, it outputs `None`.

### **Summary:**
- Functions without an explicit `return` statement return `None` by default.
- This ensures that functions always have a consistent return behavior, even if no specific value is provided.
